Description: A Bayesian generalised linear model (BGLM) is used to flag individuals with 
    intra-individual variation in their metabolite levels using repeated measurements. 
    The model can include covariates such as sex or age. Individuals are flagged when 
    their metabolite levels lie outside specified posterior predictive interval ranges.
