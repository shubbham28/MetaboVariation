Description: Metabovariation flags individuals that have significant variation in their
    metabolite levels based on assessment of repeated measures of metabolites. A  
    Bayesian generalised linear model (BGLM) is used to identify individuals with 
    variations in their metabolite levels and the model can include covariates such 
    as sex, or age. Individuals are flagged when the metabolite levels lie outside 
    of specified posterior predictive intervals.
