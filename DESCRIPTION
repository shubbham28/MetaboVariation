Description: A multivariate Bayesian generalised linear model (BGLM) is used to flag individuals with 
    intra-individual variation in their metabolite levels across repeated measurements. 
    The model can include covariates such as sex or age. Individuals are flagged when 
    their metabolite levels lie outside individual-specific posterior predictive intervals.
